<!-- *********************** INTRODUCTION *********************** -->
<h1 id="introduction" class="noBackToTop" style = "padding-top: 20px;">Introduction</h1>


<p>In a world full of cars, driving is a useful skill. Indeed, many people know how to drive. In a world full of data - such as our modern world - programming skills for data analysis are highly useful. However, many people do <em>not</em> know how to program, including many economics students &hellip; Why is data analysis so important in today's world? This is because the modern world is so rich with data, and because data underlie important decisions made in governments, firms, NGOs and elsewhere. Or, at least, that's how it should be &hellip;</p>

<p>In this course, you will learn essential elements of programming that allow you to analyze and visualize data, as well as communicate your results such that they can be distributed to decision making teams in ministries and boardrooms. So, importantly, this course is not "just" about programming. It's about the whole process of data-based decision making. This includes the collection of data, data analysis, data visualization, and communication.
</p>


<p>Now, "programming" is a sort of awe-inspiring word. What does it actually mean? During this course you will learn to understand that programming is <em>not</em> so much about making complicated calculations and statistical analysis. And it's not just about coding. What programming really is about is the <b>automation of tasks</b>. More poetically, programming is about finding universal solution procedures to problems by making use of algorithms. That sounds awesome but also pretty abstract. Keep it in mind and during the course you will learn to understand what this means.</p>

<p>In this course we will make use of the programming environment of the <em>R language</em>. R has become extremely popular as a tool for data analysis in recent years (see <a href="http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/" target = "_blank">article</a> on r4stats). R is much more popular among programmers than commercial software, with the exception of SAS and SPSS (the latter only among academics). However, SPSS offers generally less functionality. Other popular programming languages are Python and Java. Python is also quite easy to learn, however, it is somewhat cumbersome to get it running on Windows machines. As for Java, it takes considerably more time before you can do anything sophisticated. As you can see in the mentioned article, R is clearly more popular than Stata or Matlab when it comes to job requirements (in the analytics business). It is also more popular among academics, but only marginally so. However, I figured that most of you do not necessarily want to become academics, and so, all in all, R seemed the best-suited programming language for this course.</p>

<p>But why not just having an advanced course in Excel? Well, excel is not really a useful analytics tool since it is not made for programming. This means that you forgo many options to <em>automate</em> your analysis. Automation means that you write your code only once, and whenever your boss wants to see a new analysis, you change a parameter, hit a button, and within a minute you have a beautiful new report. In Excel, you would possibly be clicking around for several hours, and you would most likely make mistakes on that way. In other words, you would feel pretty miserable. You will get to understand better what I mean during this course. As a side-note, it is possible to program with Excel. However, this would require to learn the Visual Basic programming language. It seems much more practical to directly learn R, instead!</p>

<h1 id="organization-of-this-course">Organization of this course</h1>


<h2 id="structure-of-this-course" class="noBackToTop">Structure of the course</h2>

<p>This course features <a href = "https://www1.unisg.ch/org/st-ppp/vprgso16.nsf/(vwLStudienplanByNumber)/6,246,1.00?OpenDocument" target = "_blank/"> 11 units</a>. The course is structured as follows:
	<ol> <li> Introduction into the most important elements of R and data analysis; on the playground using fake data; 2 sessions
		<li> Applying programming with R "in the wild"; we will analyze data published by the Swiss National Bank; 6 sessions
		<li> Do-it-yourself group-projects and in-class presentations; 2 sessions
		<li> Open-laptop/Google exam in the last session
	</ol>

</p>

<h2 id="group-projects">Home-assignments</h2>

<p>Doing things yourself, spending time on figuring out what happens if you change this or that piece of code is absolutely essential for learning to program. Therefore, you will regularly be asked to solve some programming problems at home. Often, the home assignments involve some heavy googling.</p>

<p style = "padding-left:40px; padding-right: 70px"><span style = "color:#e60000;">NOTE: At the beginning of the class, some of you may sometimes be asked on a random basis to present your solution or &mdash; if you were not able to solve it &mdash; comment on your experience and why you run into troubles. 
</span></p>

<p style = "padding-left:40px; padding-right: 70px"><span style = "color:#e60000;">I will also regularly ask you one or a few open-ended question using the <em>Test</em> feature on StudyNet. For your answer, you may have to copy a piece of code into the answer field.</span></p>


<h2 id="group-projects">Group projects</h2>

<p>You will be working on a project where you put into practice what you have learned in this course. You will work in <b>groups of 4 students</b>. You will analyze data that highlight important aspects of a practical decision problem at the government or in a company or NGO. You are free to propose your own topic and data; however, you will need my approval.
Topics will be assigned in the session of <b>March 31</b>. You will present your results in short elevator-pitch-like presentations in the sessions on <b>May 12 and May 19. Attendence of these sessions is mandatory.</b></p>


<h2 id="exam-and-grading">Exams and grading</h2>

<p>The overall grade for this course will depend on both the quality of your group-project and the written exam. Note that you will write the exam on your own device during the last session of this course. You will be given time to upload the exam to StudyNet at the end of the session. The group assignment counts for 60 percent, the written exam for 40 percent of your overall grade. Please find further information in the <a href = "pdfs/Kursmerkblatt.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Kursmerkblatt</em></a>. The exam will include questions where you have to google for the solution of a problem that you have not yet seen in exactly this form. You will train this during the course and while working on your group project. In another type of exam question, you will have to understand a piece of code that someone else has written, potentially with a mistake. All these exam questions prepare you for real-life analytics.</p>


<h2 id="lecture-notes-and-books">Lecture notes, books, further readings &hellip;</h2>

<blockquote class="leadingQuote"><q><i>When learning to code, Google is your best friend...</i></q>
<a href = http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14830014/add-image-s-inside-a-div-with-jquery target="_blank">Stackoverflow</a></blockquote>

<p>For this course, you do not have to read any books. The best source for R documentation is the Internet, as the quote above suggests. In fact, books become quickly outdated since R is evolving rapidly. Therefore, you will have to learn to rely on googling. You will also find quite a number of good videos on Youtube. Finding solutions through googling will also be an important learning goal of this course.</p>

<p>Having said this, the most important material for this course, in terms of documentation, are the R and markdown scripts that we will work out together during classes. These scripts will contain many comments that allow you to understand what we are doing. A second important source are these notes you are just reading, in form of a simple website. I have tried my best to make this website somehow readable on any device and for any browser. However, some features do not look optimal for some browsers (sliders look somewhat ugly in Safari, and it is not possible to make the text bigger in Edge). If you encounter troubles, try to use Chrome; if that also does not work, let me know.</p>

<p style = "padding-left:40px; padding-right: 70px"><span style = "color:#e60000;">NOTE: After each class, the R scripts that we worked on during class will be published in these lecture notes, together with any remarks that seem noteworthy in light of the discussions during class.
</span></p>

<p>If you nevertheless feel better having a book in your hands, this one is actually very well written, very accessible, and still mostly up-to-date:
<ul><li>Jared P. Lander, <em>R for Everyone</em>, Addison Wesley Data & Analytics Series, 2014
</ul>
</p>

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>If you feel that a particular topic remained unclear and you want me to get back to it during the following class, or if you have suggestions for covering additional material, feel free to send an email to <span style = "color:#27738C">johannes.binswanger@unisg.ch</span>. I also set up a forum on StudyNet where you can send anonymous feedback. But please be constructive, even if it's anonymous &hellip;</p>









<!-- ************  GETTING STARTED ********************  -->




<h1 id="lecture1">Lecture 1</h1>

<p>During the first session, we did install R and RStudio. Although we had some problems with the WiFi hotspot, it worked for most or you. In this <a href="pdfs/Installing R on Win10.pdf" target = "_blank">pdf</a> you find some quick-and-dirty documentation of the most important screenshots for installing R and RStudio on a Windows 10 machine. Below, you find a simple slide show that shows the installation on a Mac.</p>

<p>To sum up, you have learned to following during this lecture:
<ul>
  <li>There are a number of different data types:
  <ul>
    <li>numeric types
    <li>character types
    <li>logical types
    <li>data frames (i.e. a sort of spreadsheet)
  </ul>
  <li> &quot;=&quot; or &quot;<-&quot; means assignment
  <li> &quot;= =&quot; means mathematical equality
</ul>
</p>

<p>Next time, we'll dig a little deeper.</p>

</pre></div>
</div></div>

<p>During class, the very last command did not achieve what we wanted, namely deleting
all empty rows for the <code>item</code> column of the dataframe. In the above script, I added two lines that actually achieve what we want. (The reason why the piece we typed in class does not work is a bit complicated, let's not bother&hellip;) </p>

<p>The most important things you have seen during this lecture are the following.
<ul>
  <li> Install a package with <code>install.packages(&lt;package name in quotes&gt;)</code>. You have to do this only once on a particular machine.
  <li> Load packages with <code>library(&lt;package name in quotes&gt;)</code>.
  <li> There is a data type <code>list</code>.
  <li> There is a data type <code>factor</code>.
  <li> You can select rows and columns from a data frame with <code>dataframe[&lt;rows&gt;,&lt;columns&gt;]</code>.
  <li> You can select multiple rows or columns, and you can <i>un</i>select columns by using a minus sign.
  <li>Use loops for &rdquo;repetitive&ldquo; tasks.
  <li>Give names to columns/variables with <code>names(dataframe)</code>.
  <li>And a few more things&hellip;
</ul>
</p>

<h1 id="lecture3">Lecture 3</h1>

<p>In this lecture, we first touched real data, downloaded them from the <a href = "https://data.snb.ch/de/topics" target = "_blank">data portal</a> of the Swiss national bank.</p>

<p>As we found out (at least some of you), downloading data in <code>csv</code> format can be tricky. Well, not the actual download, but you can get nasty surprises when discovering that the data appear in a pretty &rdquo;ugly&ldquo; format. See this <a href="pdfs/MessyCSV_screens.pdf" target = "_blank"> link</a> for some screenshots together with hints about how to proceed.</p>

<p>In sum, you have the following options when you get an &rdquo;ugly&ldquo; csv file. One or the other may work, hopefully&hellip;
<ul>
	<li>Change the regional settings of your machine to match the region of the data platform (in case of the OECD use English &ndash; United States).
	<li>Open Excel and import the &rdquo;ugly&ldquo; file from the <code>Data</code> tab, using <code>Get external data / from text</code>. Play around with the options in the import wizard. Quite often, the solution is to use <code>semicolon</code> as the delimiter, and potentially add <code>other</code>, and insert double quotes (&rdquo;) into the field next to other. This may lead to many empty columns, but it is easy to delete them after reading the data into R.
	<li>Open the &rdquo;ugly&ldquo; file with Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac). Inspect visually what's wrong and adjust the delimiter in the Excel import wizard accordingly (see previous point).
	<li>Read the &rdquo;ugly&ldquo; data into R using the <code>read.table(&hellip;)</code> command. Then use the string functions of the <code>stringr</code> package. This is a bit more advanced, we have not talked about this. But if you need it, Google and Youtube will get you there!
</ul>
</p>

<p>Note that we did not run any code in Lecture 3. We spent the time understanding and inspecting the inner life of csv files.</p>

<!-- ################################################# -->

<h1 id="lecture4">Lecture 4</h1>

<p>In Lecture 4, we did the following:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Delete all empty columns in a data frame with a loop; within the loop, we used conditional <code>if</code> statements.
<li>Getting all values in a particular column of a data frame.
<li>Making a simple annotated &rdquo;codebook&ldquo;; this is particularly useful for larger data sets.
<li> Changing particular values in a column of a data frame.
<li> Renaming columns/variables in a data frame.
</ul></p>

<p>Below you find the script we worked on during class. I added a few comments and run it on a Windows machine. Please note that we did not run the last few lines in class (they are clearly marked below, after the line with exclamation marks). Please copy them into your script and make sure they run before next class.</p>
